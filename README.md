### Bike-Sharing Dataset Analysis and Tableau Visualization
## Overview
This project involves analyzing the London bike-sharing dataset and creating visualizations using Tableau. The dataset contains information about bike rentals, including factors like weather conditions, temperature, and more.

##Files
Jupyter Notebook: The code is provided in a Jupyter Notebook file (bikes.ipynb). This notebook downloads the London bike-sharing dataset, performs data preprocessing using pandas, and then exports the cleaned data to an Excel file (london_bikes.xlsx).

Excel File: The cleaned dataset (london_bikes.xlsx) is provided in an Excel file, ready to be used for Tableau visualization.

## Steps
Download the Dataset: The code uses the Kaggle API to download the London bike-sharing dataset (london-bike-sharing-dataset.zip).

Data Preprocessing: The notebook extracts the contents of the zip file and reads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. It explores the data, renames columns, converts data types, and maps numerical values to more descriptive labels.

Export to Excel: The final cleaned dataset is exported to an Excel file (london_bikes.xlsx). This file can be directly used for visualization in Tableau.

Tableau Visualization: After exporting the dataset, you can use Tableau to create visualizations and gain insights into bike-sharing patterns based on different factors such as weather, temperature, and season. ( IMAGE AND LINK INCLUDED)
