# Heart Attack Prediction Project
## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms in SAS enterprise miner to predict the likelihood of heart attacks based on clinical features. We explore various models including logistic regression, decision trees, and a hybrid HPBNC classifier.

## Dataset
The dataset includes clinical parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure etc.. It consists of 303 samples, partitioned into training and validation sets.

## Models
Random Forest
HPBNC Classifier
Linear and Logistic regression
Neural Network

## Evaluation
Models are evaluated based on their misclassification rate and average squared error, with a focus on validation performance for model selection.

## Results
HPBNC Classifier was found to be the best model for our use case. Accuracy = 89% Misclassification rate = 10.989% Avg. squared error = 11.813%
